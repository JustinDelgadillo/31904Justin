            <h2>Beatles</h2>
            <h3>Girl - The Beatles</h3>
            <h4>Letra:</h4>
            <p>Is there anybody going to listen to my story
                All about the girl who came to stay?
                She's the kind of girl</p>
            <p>You want so much, it makes you sorry
                Still you don't regret a single day
                Ah, girl, girl</p>
            <p>When I think of all the times
                I tried so hard to leave her
                She will turn to me and start to cry</p>
            <p>And she promises the earth to me
                And I believe her
                After all this time I don't know why
                Ah, girl, girl</p>
            <p>She's the kind of girl who puts you down
                When friends are there
                You feel a fool</p>
            <p> When you say she's looking good
                She acts as if it's understood
                She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
                Girl, girl, girl</p>
            <p>Was she told when she was young
                That pain would lead to pleasure?
                Did she understand it when they said</p>
            <p>That a man must break his back
                To earn his day of leisure?
                Will she still believe it when he's dead?
                Ah, girl, girl, girl
                Ah, girl, girl</p>

                I'll get to you somehow
                Until I do, I'm telling you so you'll understand</p>
            <p>Michelle, ma belle
                Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
                Tres bien ensemble
                And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
                My Michelle</p>
